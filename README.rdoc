== README

This project Ruby Test Framework is the third version of the Fred's Test Framework.
The first one was in Tcl, the second in Perl and this one in Ruby.

The main idea behind the project is to gather all the script snippets, 
libraries, tools used for integration testing into one place and to keep
all of them documented and tested.

With the previous version, this approach as been particularly efficient
to be the base of very fast development of tools or test environments.

It is also an interesting exercise while learning a new language because it 
covers a large scope of features:  


The framework is a set of tools, scripts, libraries and tests:

* Self documented

* Unit tested

* Continuously integrated under Jenkins

* ...


This documentation is generated using "rdoc README.rdoc templates/ tools/ lib/" in the project top directory.
